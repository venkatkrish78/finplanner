## Next Steps and Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Expand test coverage**: Add tests for critical business components
2. **Configure branch protection**: Require PR checks to pass before merging
3. **Set up deployment environments**: Configure staging and production environments
4. **Add more comprehensive mocks**: Mock external services and APIs

### Future Enhancements
1. **Visual regression testing**: Add screenshot testing for UI components
2. **End-to-end testing**: Implement E2E tests with Playwright or Cypress
3. **Performance testing**: Add bundle size monitoring and performance benchmarks
4. **Accessibility testing**: Implement automated accessibility checks

### Monitoring and Maintenance
1. **Regular dependency updates**: Keep testing dependencies up to date
2. **Coverage monitoring**: Track test coverage trends over time
3. **Performance monitoring**: Monitor build times and test execution speed
4. **Documentation updates**: Keep testing guidelines current with best practices
