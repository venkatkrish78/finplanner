# Select.Item Error Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The goals edit page was experiencing a runtime error: **"A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string"**. This Radix UI error was preventing key functionalities like "Add Contributions" and "Link Investments" from working properly.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Empty SelectItem Value**: In `edit-goal-dialog.tsx`, there was a `<SelectItem value="">No category</SelectItem>` with an empty string value, which violates Radix UI's requirement that SelectItem values must be non-empty strings.

2. **Missing Dialog Functionality**: The goal detail page (`/goals/[id]/page.tsx`) had buttons for "Add Contribution" and "Link Investment" but lacked the necessary onClick handlers and dialog state management.

3. **Inadequate Error Handling**: The link-investment-dialog had potential issues when no investments were available.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Empty SelectItem Value ✅
**File**: `/app/components/edit-goal-dialog.tsx`
- **Before**: `<SelectItem value="">No category</SelectItem>`
- **After**: `<SelectItem value="no-category">No category</SelectItem>`
- **Additional**: Updated form submission logic to handle `"no-category"` value properly

### 2. Added Missing Dialog Functionality ✅
**File**: `/app/app/goals/[id]/page.tsx`
- Added dialog state management for all three dialogs:
  - `showContributionDialog`
  - `showEditDialog` 
  - `showLinkDialog`
- Added onClick handlers for all action buttons
- Imported and integrated all required dialog components:
  - `AddGoalContributionDialog`
  - `EditGoalDialog`
  - `LinkInvestmentDialog`
- Added proper error handling with toast notifications
- Added button disable states for completed goals

### 3. Enhanced Link Investment Dialog ✅
**File**: `/app/components/link-investment-dialog.tsx`
- Fixed empty state handling by using `<SelectItem value="no-investments" disabled>` instead of a plain div
- Updated form validation to reject "no-investments" selection
- Enhanced submit button logic to disable when no valid investment is selected
- Added proper error handling for edge cases

### 4. Improved Error Handling ✅
- Added toast notifications for success/error states
- Added proper loading states and disabled button logic
- Enhanced data validation and edge case handling
- Added confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
